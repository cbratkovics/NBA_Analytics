HYPOTHESIS 1: REST DAYS IMPACT ON SHOOTING EFFICIENCY
--------------------------------------------------
Sample Sizes:
  Well Rested: 64,077 observations
  Not Well Rested: 12,166 observations

Descriptive Statistics:
  Well Rested Mean: 0.4708
  Not Well Rested Mean: 0.4649
  Difference: 0.0058

Test Statistics:
  T-statistic: 3.3998
  P-value (two-tailed): 0.000675
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.0336

Conclusion (α = 0.05):
  Reject H0
  Effect size interpretation: negligible

NBA Value & Practical Significance:
  Rest impacts shooting efficiency by 0.6% on average.
  This suggests load management strategies may have measurable benefits.


HYPOTHESIS 2: HOME VS. AWAY PERFORMANCE DIFFERENTIALS
--------------------------------------------------
Sample Sizes:
  Home Games: 84,704 observations
  Away Games: 84,457 observations

Descriptive Statistics:
  Home Mean: 7.0719
  Away Mean: 6.9616
  Difference: 0.1103

Test Statistics:
  T-statistic: 2.5740
  P-value (two-tailed): 0.010054
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.0125

Conclusion (α = 0.05):
  Reject H0
  Effect size interpretation: negligible

NBA Value & Practical Significance:
  Home court advantage results in 0.11 additional points per game.
  This quantifies the value of playing at home for individual players.


HYPOTHESIS 3: EVOLUTION OF 3-POINT ATTEMPT RATES
--------------------------------------------------
Sample Sizes:
  Season 2022: 17,464 observations
  Season 2024: 17,201 observations

Descriptive Statistics:
  Season 2022 Mean: 5.1426
  Season 2024 Mean: 5.7030
  Difference: 0.5604

Test Statistics:
  T-statistic: 14.7119
  P-value (one-tailed): 0.000000
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.1581

Conclusion (α = 0.05):
  Reject H0
  Effect size interpretation: negligible

NBA Value & Practical Significance:
  3-point attempts increased by 0.56 per 36 minutes between seasons.
  This confirms the continued evolution toward perimeter-oriented offense.


OVERALL SUMMARY
------------------------------
Tests conducted: 3
Significant results: 3
Success rate: 100.0%

Key findings from significant results:
  • Hypothesis 1: Rest Days Impact on Shooting Efficiency
  • Hypothesis 2: Home vs. Away Performance Differentials
  • Hypothesis 3: Evolution of 3-Point Attempt Rates

Methodological Notes:
	All tests used α = 0.05 significance level
	Both parametric (t-test) and non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U) tests conducted
	Effect sizes calculated using Cohen's d for practical significance assessment
	Assumptions testing included normality and equal variance checks
