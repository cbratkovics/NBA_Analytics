    "* **`height` and `weight`**: The API provides height as a string (e.g., \"6-4\"). Weight is also often a string from the API but might appear numeric if all values are numbers.\n",
    "* **`position`**: Can sometimes be empty or have combined positions like \"F-C\".\n",
    "* **`team_id` (Player vs. Stat context):**\n",
    "    * In `df_players`, `team_id` (and the other `team_*` columns) refers to the team information *nested within the player object*. This generally represents the player's current or most recently known team affiliation *at the time the player data was fetched*.\n",
    "    * This is distinct from the `team_id` you'd find in `df_player_stats`, where `team_id` refers to the team for which a specific game statistic was recorded.\n",
    "* **`player_team_id` vs `team_id` in `df_player_stats`**: In your `df_player_stats` (from the previous data dictionary we discussed), you had both `player_team_id` and `team_id`.\n",
    "    * `player_team_id` came from `player.team_id` within the stat's player object.\n",
    "    * `team_id` came from the `team.id` directly associated with the stat (i.e., the team the player played *for* in that game).\n",
    "    This distinction is important for player movement and trades. In `df_players`, you only have one set of team columns, prefixed with `team_`, representing the team associated with the player record.\n",

    "    * `time` can provide more specific details, like the clock time in a quarter if the game is live, or be empty/ \"Final\" for completed games.\n",
