HYPOTHESIS 1: REST DAYS IMPACT ON SHOOTING EFFICIENCY
--------------------------------------------------
Sample Sizes:
  Well Rested: 64,389 observations
  Not Well Rested: 12,166 observations

Descriptive Statistics:
  Well Rested Mean: 0.4707
  Not Well Rested Mean: 0.4649
  Difference: 0.0058

Test Statistics:
  T-statistic: 3.3842
  P-value (two-tailed): 0.000714
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.0335

Conclusion (α = 0.05):
  Reject H0
  Effect size interpretation: negligible

NBA Value & Practical Significance:
  Rest impacts shooting efficiency by 0.6% on average.
  This suggests load management strategies may have measurable benefits.


HYPOTHESIS 2: HOME VS. AWAY PERFORMANCE DIFFERENTIALS
--------------------------------------------------
Sample Sizes:
  Home Games: 85,049 observations
  Away Games: 84,802 observations

Descriptive Statistics:
  Home Mean: 7.0755
  Away Mean: 6.9623
  Difference: 0.1131

Test Statistics:
  T-statistic: 2.6454
  P-value (two-tailed): 0.008161
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.0128

Conclusion (α = 0.05):
  Reject H0
  Effect size interpretation: negligible

NBA Value & Practical Significance:
  Home court advantage results in 0.11 additional points per game.
  This quantifies the value of playing at home for individual players.


HYPOTHESIS 3: EVOLUTION OF 3-POINT ATTEMPT RATES
--------------------------------------------------
Sample Sizes:
  Season 2022: 17,464 observations
  Season 2024: 17,488 observations

Descriptive Statistics:
  Season 2022 Mean: 5.1426
  Season 2024 Mean: 5.6957
  Difference: 0.5531

Test Statistics:
  T-statistic: 14.5975
  P-value (one-tailed): 0.000000
  Effect Size (Cohen's d): 0.1562

Conclusion (α = 0.05):
  Reject H0
  Effect size interpretation: negligible

NBA Value & Practical Significance:
  3-point attempts increased by 0.55 per 36 minutes between seasons.
  This confirms the continued evolution toward perimeter-oriented offense.


OVERALL SUMMARY
------------------------------
Tests conducted: 3
Significant results: 3
Success rate: 100.0%

Key findings from significant results:
  Hypothesis 1: Rest Days Impact on Shooting Efficiency
  Hypothesis 2: Home vs. Away Performance Differentials
  Hypothesis 3: Evolution of 3-Point Attempt Rates

Methodological Notes:
	All tests used α = 0.05 significance level
	Both parametric (t-test) and non-parametric (Mann-Whitney U) tests conducted
	Effect sizes calculated using Cohen's d for practical significance assessment
	Assumptions testing included normality and equal variance checks
