BUSINESS VALUE:
   • Provides data-driven edge in fantasy sports and betting
   • Enables evidence-based coaching and player management decisions
   • Creates opportunities for media content and fan engagement
   • Supports objective player evaluation and contract negotiations

TECHNICAL ACHIEVEMENTS:
   • Implemented robust data leakage prevention
   • Applied advanced feature engineering and selection
   • Used time-aware cross-validation for realistic performance estimates
   • Created production-ready deployment framework
   • Achieved meaningful predictive accuracy across all target variables

RECOMMENDATIONS:
   1. DEPLOY: Implement models in production for real-time predictions
   2. MONITOR: Set up model performance monitoring and drift detection
   3. ITERATE: Continuously retrain models with new data
   4. EXPAND: Consider additional metrics and defensive statistics
   5. INTEGRATE: Build API endpoints for external system integration
